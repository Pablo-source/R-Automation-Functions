This folder includes R scripts using DPLYR to optimse daily data manipulations. Comprises several verbs used for data wrangling

# 01 DPLYR recode variables.R
- Using mutate() and recode() DPLYR verbs to recode original variable values. Useful when some vars have long and winded names.

# 02 DPLYR subset rows percentage IN.R
- Combination of filter() and %in% verbs to subset categories based on an adhoc vector

# 03 DPLYR variable frequency summary table.R
- Obtain count of variable values using group_by(Indic_ID) combined with
  summarize( freq = n()), end this script by using arrange(desc(freq)) to display frequency values in descending order
  
# 04 DPLYR case_when recode long names.R
- Recode previous values into a new variable with shorter variable names.
- The case_when() function includes inside the parenthesis two components
  separated by a tilde (~): 

a) In the left side there is a condition that is evaluated as TRUE
b) In the right side of the tilde there is the value of the output if the condition is evaluated as TRUE
- We use case_when in this instance to create a new column in the data frame
- We use case_when to implement a logic that test for a single condition, outputting a value if that condition is evaluated as TRUE.

# 05 DPLYR case_when simple recode.R
- case_when can be used to recode variables, left side of the tilde expression contains the old variable values and right side of the tilde includes new recoded values

# 06 DPLYR filter IN and NOT IN.R 
There is the IN verb in DPLYR used mainly to filter data including certain categories. We can include certain values using a c() concatenate function to list values to keep from a bigger data set.

# 07 DPLYR case_when recode long variable names
Similar example as simple recode, we can use it to recode long winded variables values into simple and shorter more convenient ones

# 08 DPLYR using filter() with str_detect() 
This is a way of subsetting rows from a data set where we use 
specific string searches to identify long and winded variable names

# 09 DPLYR case_when recode long names
This is another example on how to use case_when to recode variable names when subsetting rows using filter() function
