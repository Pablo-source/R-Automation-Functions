This folder includes R scripts using DPLYR to optimse daily data manipulations

# 01 DPLYR recode variables.R
- Using mutate() and recode() DPLYR verbs to recode original variable values. Useful when some vars have long and winded names.

# 02 DPLYR subset rows percentage IN.R
- Combination of filter() and %in% verbs to subset categories based on an adhoc vector

# 03 DPLYR variable frequency summary table.R
- Obtain count of variable values using group_by(Indic_ID) combined with
  summarize( freq = n()), end this script by using arrange(desc(freq)) to display frequency values in descending order
  
# 04 DPLYR case_when recode long names.R
- Recode previous values into a new variable with shorter variable names.
- The case_when() function includes inside the parenthesis two components
  separated by a tilde (~): 

a) In the left side there is a condition that is evaluated as TRUE
b) In the right side of the tilde there is the value of the output if the condition is evaluated as TRUE
- We use case_when in this instance to create a new column in the data frame
- We use case_when to implement a logic that test for a single condition, outputting a value if that condition is evaluated as TRUE.
